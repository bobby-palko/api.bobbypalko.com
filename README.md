# Personal API

API endpoints for my personal website, which is used to monitor and keep track of things in my life such as:

- fitness/weight
- chores/housekeeping
- other "to-do" items

and probably more as I think of it!

## Features

Currently just notes for my own tracking. If I decide to scale this app and make it open to the public this will be cleaned up

### User Auth

- Lock API endpoints behind auth
- Sign in to view the life dashboard - currently only set to me

### Chores

- Set frequency for the chore i.e. how often it needs to be completed
  - Every x amount of days, weeks, months, etc. (every 10 days, every other month)
  - On a specific day (on Mondays, on the 3rd of the month, on March 15th every year)
  - As needed (for things like washing dishes, etc)
- See the last time this chore was completed
- Be able to mark a chore as completed
- Be able to add a chore
- Assign chores to specific rooms (living room, kitchen)
